An Octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy
=================================================

This repository contains all the source code and teaching material needed to build and construct an octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy with acoustic sensors for distance sensing and a camera for object detection.  It runs off 9 AA cells, has a built in voltage regulator and a 3D printed camera bracket.

The project is at 1st undergrad level.
