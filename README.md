An Octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy
=================================================

This repository contains all the source code and teaching material needed to build and construct an octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy with acoustic sensors for distance sensing and a camera for object detection.  It runs off 9 AA cells, has a built in voltage regulator and a 3D printed camera bracket.

- *Work sheet 1* : Building the buggy
- *Work sheet 2* : Introduction to Octave on the PI
- *Work sheet 3* : Output, controlling the motors and LEDs
- *Work sheet 4* : Input, echo sensors, switches and cameras.
- *Work sheet 5* : Image recognition
- *Work sheet 6* : The buggy challenge, an obstetrical course for the buggies.

This buggy building workshop was originally run in Feb 2018, and rewritten in Feb 2020 at the University of Nottingham, UK.


Time taken to build/do the work sheets
--------------------------------------

This project is meant to take 1st year mechanical engineering undergraduate students 4x4hr sessions over 4 weeks.
