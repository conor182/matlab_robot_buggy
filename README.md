matlab_robot_buggy
==================

This repository contains all the source code and teaching material needed to build and construct an octave/MATLAB powered Raspberry PI robot buggy with acoustic sensors for distance sensing and a camera for object detection.  It runs off 9 AA cells, has a built in voltage regulator and a 3D printed camera bracket.

The project is at 1st undergrad level.

- *Work sheet 1* : Building the buggy
- *Work sheet 2* : Input output

- *Work sheet 4* : The buggy challenge, an obstetrical course for the buggies.

Do with it what you will, I release everything under CC-BY.
