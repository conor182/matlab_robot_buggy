Worksheet 6
===========

The buggy challenge
-------------------
Your buggy is trapped in a valley, infested by a rather large rabbit who likes to eat buggies.  Your buggy must find the exit to the valley without bumping into the valley walls, or encountering the rabbit.  The rabbit lives in an area marked off by *black masking tape*, if the buggy enters the area where the bunny lives it will get eaten, and the game will be over.

There are also some rocks (Easter eggs) scattered around the valley which your buggy must avoid as they can get trapped in the wheels.  The exit is denoted by a white chalk road (in this case an A3 sheet of white paper.)

As a group, edit your buggy code so that your buggy will search for and find the white road as quickly as possible without bumping into the rabbit or running over the smarties.  50% will be given if you attempt the exercise with a reasonable answer.  Another 25% will be given for for finding the white piece of paper and the remaining 25% will be given depending on how well your buggy performs, and any cool your answer is(!)  Rules of the game:

- The buggy must find the white piece of paper to win the game.
- If it bumps into the bunny, the game is over.
- Your buggy must avoid mountains (plastic boxes) and valley walls (detonated by the barrier).  If it hits these object the game will not end but it will waste time.
- Avoid the Easter eggs so that the buggy does not get stuck.

How you achieve this aim is up to you. Here are some ideas of how to solve the problem.

- Use your answers to WS3 to detect the smarties and the bunny (note the bunny will never leave the area surrounded by the black tape.)

- Use the echo sensor to avoid the objects such a the walls and the mountains.

- Move the buggy randomly, until it sees the white piece of paper *or* a systematic search for the exit.

Mod your buggy
--------------
- Your buggy has enough hardware to accomplish this task, but if you fancy adding extra motors and or acoustic sensors we do have some spare. But you have to figure out how to use them.  I think 4 motors might be a fun thing to try, I do have some spare motors for a few groups.   :wink:
- Try making the LEDs flash a set code depending on what the buggy is doing.

How to get your marks....
-------------------------
Take your buggy to the arena, demonstrate it works, then after you have completed the challenge, take your buggy to bits and place it back in the tool box  **The tool box must look exactly how it was when it was given to you.**  Once this has been signed off by a demonstrator, you may go!

How to use your scripts from WS3 with the buggy
-----------------------------------------------

In MATLAB you used the *imread* command, although this was useful at reading images from files on a PC, on the buggy we are able to get a live image from the camera rather. Use the *camera()* command to take a new image.  This command will save the image to /home/pi/image.jpg, and then the *imread* command to read in the image, followed by the *flipud* command to orientate the image correctly, followed by *get_color* function you wrote for WS3 to extract the average rgb values.  Hint: You will have to copy your *get_color* function from your PC to the buggy.

**Step 3:** Next lab session your buggy will have to navigate an obstacle course, see figure 1.  Your buggy will have to find the exit (marked by a white piece of paper), avoid being eaten by the rabbit, which is lives in an area surrounded by black tape, avoid bumping into the walls, and ideally avoid the patch of Easter eggs before exiting the course.  These tasks can be accomplished by using a combination of the camera and the ultrasonic sensor.

However to do this task we need sample images of the black tape, smarties and the white piece of paper.  Ask Rod (or a demonstrator ) for these objects.  Take pictures of each of the objects with the buggy camera naming them black.jpg, eggs.jpg and exit.jpg.  [Hint: I would not eat the smarties… they have spent quite a long time kicking around my office!]

**Step 4:** Insert a USB stick into the PI, and copy off the images to a USB stick.  If you  can’t work out how to do this, ask a demonstrator.  We will be using these images in the rest of the questions.

The rest of the work sheet will be individual work, not group work, done on the PCs in the computer room, on your laptop or at home.  (Usual plagiarism rules apply... sorry) When you finished the programming your code, we will copy your files back to the PI, and test them.

Question 2
----------
Start up MATLAB on your PC.  We are now going to write some simple code to do some image recognition.  The image recognition will be based on color detection.  In a new script called q1.m use the imread and imshow command to read in the image and display the image of the floor.  What do you notice about the image?  Use the manual to look up what the flipud command does.  Have a go at using it.  What does it do to the image?  Save this script as q1.m

Question 3
----------
**Step 1:** We are now going to write a function to calculate the average color of a image, and use the average color the camera sees to identify objects.  Think how placing an orange and then an apple in an image would affect the average color of the image.  If you can’t remember how functions work, revise this section in your notes.  Make a new MATLAB file and save it as *get_color.m*.  In this file we are going to make a function, copy and paste the following code, which will define a function into the file:

~~~~
function [r g b] = get_color(data)
r=1;
g=2;
b=3;
end
~~~~

Save your file *get_color.m* then from then on the command line type

~~~~
[r g b]=get_color(1)
~~~~

What values does this function return?  Change the function so that it returns r=5, g=6 and b=7. 

**Step 2:** Color images are made up of pixels, each pixel has a red, green and blue component, the values of the red, green and blue components can range form 0 to 255.  So for example, a very red pixel would be represented by the three numbers 255,0,0 or a very green pixel would be represented by the three numbers 0,255,0 and a blue pixel would be represented by the values 0,0,255.  What value would a black and gray pixel be represented by?

Have a play with this web page to understand this a bit better:
[web page](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_converter.asp)  What are the RGB values of your favourite color?  Look up the RGB values for purple and save them in your script as a comment.

**Setp 3**: By looking at the color components of any image 
we can guess what could be in the image.  For example if the image is of the floor in the L3 lab, it will consist of lots of gray pixels.  If the image is full of colorful Easter eggs, it will have a wide range of colors etc...

In the next part of the example sheet we are going to edit the the function *get_color(x)* return the average intensity of red, green and blue pixels in our image.  By following the steps you will be able to do this.

Question 4
----------
**step 1:** Rather than calling your get_color(x) function from the command line, make a new script called  *detect.m*, and in that script call you function by adding the line of code:
~~~~
get_color(1)
~~~~

**step 2**: Currently we are passing the get_color function the value of 1,  we don't want to do this we would like to pass it an image from the camera.  So using imread in the script *detect.m*, read the image *floor.jpb* into a variable *a* and pass it to your function by using the code

~~~~
get_color(a)
~~~~

Now in your *get_color()* function use the command *imshow*, so that the function will display any image which is passed to it.


**Step 3:** We now need to define two nested loops to iterate over every pixel in our image.  For now we are going to pretend our image is 100x100 pixels big.  Inside the function *get_color*, underneath your *imshow* command define two nested for loops, one which counts using the variable x from 1 to 100 and one which counts using the variable y from 1 to 100.  If you can't remember what a nested loop is refer to your notes.

**step 4**:  Using the *sprintf* and the *disp* commands print out all the values of *x* and *y*, over which the loops count.

**step 5**:  We know that this image is bigger than 100x100 pixels.  Use the *size* command to store the *x* and *y* size of the image in the variables *x_len* and *y_len*.  Change your for loops so rather than counting to 100, they count to x_len and y_len.

**Step 6**:  In the CW2 we played with a black and white (sometimes called gray scale) image of the science museum.  We learnt that gray scale images are stored in a 2D matrix, with a value between 0-255 representing the value of each pixel. Zero represents the color black and 255 represents the color white, and all values between being shades of gray.  If one wanted to extract the intensity at 50,50 pixel form an image stored in the array *data*, we would use the code:

~~~~~
data(50,50)
~~~~~

However our image is not gray scale it is a color image.  In Color images as I mentioned above we store red, green and blue pixels.  Therefore at each position in the image there is a red green and blue value stored.  To access the red value at 50,50 we would use the command

~~~~~
data(50,50,1)
~~~~~

To access the green value we would use the command:

~~~~~
data(50,50,2)
~~~~~

and to access the blue value we would use the command:

~~~~~
data(50,50,3)
~~~~~

Edit your *sprtinf* statement to display the red, green and blue values of the pixels at every x,y value your nested for loops count over.

Question 5
----------
**Step 1:** We are now going to edit the function so that it sums, all the values of the red pixels in the the image. First delete the lines:

~~~~
r=1;
g=2;
b=3;
~~~~

from your function.  At the top of your function (but still in your function) define the counter r=0.0. Within the nested loop add the line of code

~~~~
r=r+int32(a(x,y,1));
~~~~

>What is this line of code doing?  Write your answer as a comment in your script.

By writing *int32* before the a, we are just telling MATLAB/Octave to use an *int32* type variable to store the sum of all the red pixels.  An *int32*, is a special type of variable which can store very big numbers, we are using this as we expect the value of *r* to get very big.  The technical term for this is *type casting*.  Now add corresponding lines for the blue, and green colors, just as we did for the red color.  After your nested loops add the commands:

~~~~
r
g
b
~~~~

To show you the totals of the red green and blue in the images.
Now test out the function again on the command line.  You should get some large values for r,g and b returned.

**Step 2:** Returning the sum of red, green and blue, pixels is not so useful. What we want really is the function to return the average values of the red, green and blue pixels.  So add to your function a variable (called count) which adds up the number of pixels over which the r,g,b values are summed.  Then at the end of your function, divide r,g and b values by count.  [An alternative way of doing this is to divide the totals by y_len*x_len] Test your function again by running the script, *detect.m*.  It should now return the average pixel intensity, for the region defined in figure 1.

**Step 3:** Change your script *detect.m* to load *black.jpg* and *eggs.jpg*.  What values do you get out?  Are they different for each object?  If so how different?

Question 6
----------
**Step 1:** We have now written a function to detect the color of an object.  All we need now it to change our program to figure out which color relates to which object.  Depending on the light in the room the exact values from the camera may change so rather than saying the average color from a section of black tape is 0,0,0 we could say that black tape has values of *red<50* and *green<50*, *blue<50*.  I would use this code to check if an object is black or not:



copy and paste this code into detect.m.  Does it work?  Copy and paste this code, while changing the values to detect the color white representing the exit.  Does it work or does it get confused?

Question 7 (bonus question):
----------------------------

Now try to adjust your script to identify the picture of the Easter eggs.

Wile group work is fun, it’s also fun to do your own thing.  So for this worksheet, all parts are to be done individually, except Question 0 which you will have to do in a group. The usual plagiarism rules will apply for all but question 0. As ever, the demonstrators in the lab are here to help you.  For all questions but number 0, you can use matlab on the computers in C19/C20, you don’t need the buggy.

Question 0: You will have noticed that your buggy has a camera.  In this worksheet we will be using the camera to detect objects and ultimately, to help the buggy avoid objects (although that will be in the next lab).
Step 1: Make a new octave (MATLAB) script, add the addpath(‘/home/pi/lib’) command as usual. Then add the command camera() to the script. Save and run the script and you will see that an image has been written to /home/pi/image.jpg .  To open this image, click on the folder icon in the top left of the screen (it is the third icon from the left, next to the raspberry).  If you now double click on image.jpg you will see a picture of what the camera was looking at.

Step 2: Now, put the buggy on the floor, with all the wires still plugged in. Make sure the buggy has a clear view of the floor, with no wires, cables, bags books etc.. in the way. Then take another image using  your script.  Rename the image by right clicking on it, and call it ‘floor.jpg’.
Step 3: Next lab session your buggy will have to navigate an obstetrical course, see figure 1.  Your buggy will have to find the exit (marked by a white piece of paper), avoid being eaten by the rabbit, which is lives in an area surrounded by yellow tape, avoid bumping into the walls, and ideally find the patch of smarties before exiting the course.  These tasks can be accomplished by using a combination of the camera and the ultrasonic sensor.
However to do this task we need sample images of the yellow tape, smarties and the white piece of paper.  Ask Rod (or a demonstrator ) for these objects.  Take pictures of each of the objects with the buggy camera naming them yellow_tape.jpg, smarties.jpg and exit.jpg.  [Hint: I would not eat the smarties… they have spent quite a long time kicking around my office!]
Step 4: Insert a USB stick into the PI, and copy off the images to a USB stick.  If you  can’t work out how to do this, ask a demonstrator.  We will be using these images in the rest of the questions.
The rest of the work sheet will be individual work, not group work, done on the PCs in the computer room, on your laptop or at home.  (Usual plagiarism rules apply… sorry) When you finished the programming your code, we will copy your files back to the PI, and test them.

Question 1: Start up MATLAB on your PC.  We are now going to write some simple code to do some image recognition.  The image recognition will be based on colour detection.  In a new script called q1.m use the imread and imshow command to read in the image and display the image.  What do you notice about the image?  Use the manual to look up what the flipud command does.  Have a go at using it.  What does it do to the image?  Save this script as q1.m

Question 2: We are now going to write a function, to calculate the average colour of a image.


Three outputs:
r: the average value of the intensity red pixels within the image.
g: the average value of the intensity green pixels within the image.
b: the average value of the intensity blue pixels within the image.

The function will be called like this:
[r, g, b]=get_color(a)
 We will use the values of r, g and b to identify the object in front of the camera.  For example the blue carpet may have lots of blue in it, so if the function returns the value of 0,0,200 we could guess we are looking at the carpet.  If the function returned a value with lots of red in it i.e. 200,0,0 we could guess that we were looking at something red, like an apple.  This type of image recognition is good for object detection and identifying green apples from oranges, but not for complex tasks such as number plate recognition.
Step 1: Make a new script called get_color.m (note US spelling, as it is common in computing), and define the function get_color within the script.  If you can’t remember how to make functions (or never knew because you missed the lecture….. :) ), go and revise this from the lecture material.  If you get stuck with this ask a demonstrator.  Just for now and to test your function, make your function return the values of 50,50,50.
Step 2: In the command window, load your image into variable a, using the imread command.
Step 3: Test your function by typing [r,g,b]=get_color(a,200,200,20,20) into the command line, this should return 50,50,50, if you set up your function correctly.
Step 4: Inside the function get_color, define two nested for loops, one which counts using the variable x and one which counts using the variable y. Make the x loop count from x_start to x_start+width, and make the y loop count from y_start to y_start+height. To test if this works, use the sprintf command to print out the values of x and y.  When you execute get_color(a,200,200,20,20), again, the function should print out all the x,y values over which the loop counnts.
Step 5: If you have done the example sheet on image processing, you will know all about how images are stored as red green and blue values in a matrix. [This is the example sheet with the cat with different colored eyes.] If you have not done this example sheet, I suggest you go and revise it, it will explain basic image processing to you.  In there I explain about how colored images are stored in detail.  I will now quickly revise the topic….  Black and white images are stored in a 2D matrix, a value of 255 stored in the matrix, represents white pixel, while a value of 0 represents a black pixel, values in between represent different grey colours.  Coloured images, work in the same way, except instead of using a 2D array, they use a 3D array, where the last dimension selects the colour.  If for example you had a coloured image stored in the variable ‘a’ and wanted to access the red pixel at 50,50 you would write a(50,50,1), if you wanted to access the green value stored in the same location you would type a(50,50,2), and finally the blue value would be accessed by typing, a(50,50,3).  Edit your sprtinf statement to display the red, green and blue values of the pixels at every x,y value your nested for loops count over.
Step 6: We are now going to edit the function so that it sums, all the values of the red pixels in the box defined, by the inputs to the function.  At the top of your function define the counter r=0.0, in the loop add the line r=r+int32(a(x,y,1)).  By writing int32 before the a, we are just telling MATLAB/Octave to use an int32 type variable to store the sum of all the red pixels.  An int32, is a special type of variable which can store very big numbers, we are using this as we expect the value of r to get very big.  The technical term for this is type casting, I won’t go into it in detail now, but you can google it if you are interested.  Now add corresponding lies for the blue, and green colours, just as we did for the red colour.  Now test out the function again on the command line.  You should get some large values for r,g and b returned. (In step one you set r,g,b to 50, if you have not already done this take out those liens of code.)
Step 7: Returning the sum of red,green and blue, pixels is not so useful. What we want really is the function to return the average values of the red, green and blue pixels.  So add to your function a variable (called count) which adds up the number of pixels over which the r,g,b values are summed.  Then at the end of your function, divide r,g and b values by count.  Test your function out again on the command line.  It should now return the average pixel intensity, for the region defined in figure 1.
Step 8: Try to load desk.jpg and object.jpg and run them through your function.  What values do you get out?  Are they different for each object?  If so how different?

Question 2: We have now written a function to detect the colour of an object.  All we need now is another function to compare the detected r,g,b values to know r,g,b values to decide if an object has been detected.  Define a new function in a new .m file which is called delta as follows:
ret=delta(r0,g0,b0,r1,g1,b1,tol)
This function will take two sets of RGB values and compare them.  It will return -1 if they differ more than tol (tolerance), and 0 if they differ by less than tol.  Calculate the difference between the two sets of RGB values using the equation.


Question 3: Use the function you developed in question 1 to identify the r,g,b values for the picture of the desk and the picture of the object.  Write a script to load in an image and tell the user using the disp command if it is a picture of the desk or the object.
Question 4: On the raspberry PI, if you wanted to get an image from the camera and identify what it was.  You would use the camera() command to take a new image which will save it in /home/pi/image.jpg, and then the imread command to read in the image, followed by the flipud command to orientate the image correctly, followed by get_color to extract the average rgb values.  You will need to do this a lot, so it therefore makes sense to put them all in a single function.
Step 1: Define a new function, called get_real_world_rgb, in a new file called get_real_world_rgb.m which calls, camera(), imread(), and get_color in order, and returns the r,g,b values returned by get_color.
Step 2: Clearly the camera() command won’t work on the PC as it does not have a camera attached to it, and if you try to run this function it will just return an error.  Therefore, edit  get_real_world_rgb so that it accepts a variable called count.  In the function get_real_world_rgb, move the function calls camera(), imread(), and get_color commands in side an if statement, and only allow them the be executed if count is equal to -1.  Thus the functions which only work on the buggy, will only be called if count==-1.
Step 3: Now edit the function again, to display the words ‘running on a PC’, if count is not equal to -1.  By changing the value of count, you can now select if the functions applicable to the PI are run or not, thus your code is now multi platform. :)
Step 4: Very often you won’t have access to a piece of equipment you have been asked to program.  An example of this could be developing code to run a cruise missile, not every programmer who programs the missile will have one on his desk.  So often programmers need to write functions to act like hardware would act even though the hardware is not present.
We are now going to edit the function,  get_real_world_rgb, to act as if it were on the PI, even though we are using it on a PC.  Within the if statement where ‘running on a PC’ is printed out, add an if else statement, where if the value of count equals 5, the image object.jpg is loaded into variable ‘a’, and  if the value of count is not equal to 5 the image desk.jpg is loaded into variable ‘a’, then follow this by the  get_color commands to enable the function to return the r,g,b values of the image.  What you should have now is a function, which will capture data from the camera of the PI, when count is equal to -1, and then count is above -1 it will load images from disk to pretend the function is running on the PI.
Question 5:
Step 1: Make a new script buggy.m, which defines the variable count.  Then using the variable count, counts from 0 to 100, using a while loop.  In side the while loop, use the get_real_world_rgb command to get r,g,b values.  Pass count to get_real_world_rgb.
Step 2: Using the delta function, within the loop, write out the text. ‘moving buggy forwards’, if  get_real_world_rgb returns rgb values corresponding to the desk.  And writes out the text ‘turn and reverse!!!!! Object detected!!!’ if the rgb values don’t correspond to the desk.
Step 3: Edit your script so that if an object is detected, it:
Prints out “1111”
waits for 1 second.
Prints out “0000”
waits for 1 second.
Prints out “1111”
waits for 1 second.
Prints out “0000”
waits for 1 second.

Question 6: Your script buggy.m is now ready to be copied over to the buggy and tested. Before you do that, in buggy.m where you pass the variable count to get_real_world_rgb, replace it with -1.  This will make get_real_world_rgb call the camera() command. Also replace the disp command you used to print 1111 and 0000 to the screen with the command to turn on and off the LEDs.  Finally, replace ‘moving buggy forwards’ and ‘turn and reverse!!!!! Object detected!!!’ with commands to move the motors of the buggy.  Get a demonstrator to check your script before you copy it to the buggy, and test it. [Hint, if you want to test the buggy on the carpet you will need to determine the rgb values of the carpet for the buggy to work]
Question 7: Edit your script so that, when it starts it automatic takes a picture of what it first sees then compares all subsequent images to these values to determine if an object has been encountered.

out the values from the echo sensor.  Now using an if statement, run the motors for 1 second if the distance detected is more than 45cm, if a distance of less than 45 cm, is detected make the code wait for 5 second using the sleep command.
