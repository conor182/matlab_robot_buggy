An extra work sheet
===================

Who is this work sheet for?
---------------------------
This work sheet is for people who missed the first lab session and DO NOT HAVE AN EC FORM.  If you were ill then you should apply for an EC form.  If you complete this exercise sheet you will get compensated for the lab and the marks you missed.  The lab sheet focuses on the last couple of lectures.

Question 1 - files
------------------
**a)** Using the fopen and fclose commands, write a program to write the words "Hello world!" to a file.

**b)** Using the code from Q1, and a for loop write the words "hello world!" to the file 100 times.

Question 2 - input and if statements
------------------------------------

**a)** Write a script to ask the user to input a number, get your script to calculate the square of the number.

**b)**If the number 10 is entered, make your script print the word "The number 10 has been entered".

**c)** If a number higher than 255 is entered your script should print to the screen the words “error: Value too high.”.

**d)** If a negative number is entered, your script should multiply the number by -1 before displaying it.

Question 3 - algorithms
-----------------------

**a)** Plot the function
~~~~
f(x)=(5x^3+15x^2+x+10)
~~~~
between the values of -10.0 and 10.0.

**b)** Use while loops and Newtons method to solve the above equation.  What answer does your script give you for an initial guess of x=10. [Hint you can basically copy the answer out of the notes.]

**c)**  Write an algorithm to integrate the function from -10 to +10.
